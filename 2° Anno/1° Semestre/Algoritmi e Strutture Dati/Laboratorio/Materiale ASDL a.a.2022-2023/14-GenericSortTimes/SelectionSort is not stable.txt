Selectionsort is not stable.

Suppose the array is
5 2 3 8 4 5 6
Let's distinguish the two 5's as 5(a) and 5(b) .

So our array is:
5(a) 3 4 5(b) 2 6 8

After iteration 1:
2 will be swapped with the element in 1st position:

So our array becomes:
2 3 4 5(b) 5(a) 6 8


Which of the sorting algorithms are stable?
